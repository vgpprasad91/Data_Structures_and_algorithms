# Data_Structures_and_algorithms

Review time. This is the time to review some of the basic knowledge of ours in the field of data structures and algorithms

* Anagram pattern search, valid anagram, Repeated DNA sequence, permutations, check balanced parenthese, Longest subset with consecutive numbers - Hash Table
* Subset sum problem, Palindrome Partitioning, Longest palindromic substring - Dynamic programming with the truth table
* Longest palindromic subsequence, Longest common substring, Longest common subsequence, Minimum edit distance, Minimum of trials to reach from source to destination - Dynamic programming with numbers
* Shortest palindrome, repeated substring pattern, Implement strStr() - KMP partial match algorithm
* Reverse words in a string, Distinct binary strings of length n with no consecutive 1s, word break - General
* Remove spaces from a given string - Linear Traverse
* Postfix expression evaluation, valid palindrome, check balanced parenthese - stack
* Multiply strings - Nth digit
* Reverse Words in a string - Rotate
